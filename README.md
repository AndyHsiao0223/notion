# Notion(unfinished)
I didn't finished email sending and finished notion. I can deploy it on ngrok, but routes didn't work. It seems like a vhost problem that I didn't solved.

Frontend js effects are easy with js kits, I used about 2 hour to solved them. Most of time I just find reliable kits, avoid some kits are no longer maintained.

This is my first time use PHP and it's framework Laravel. PHP is easy to understand but let me feel not rigorous enough compare with TS and Java. Laravel is powerful but not easy to hands-on for me. Realizing its file architecture and how it works(route -> controller -> model -> migration ... -> view) is a big issue.

There are something else like phpmyadmin, xampp, composer, apache spend me lots of time. Thought the project didn't finished, it gave me many first practices and let me touch more things I never wanted to know before. Thanks for 威誠資訊 give me the chance to venture outside my comfort zone!
